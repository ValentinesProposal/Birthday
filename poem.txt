
In a realm of code and binary's embrace,
There dwells a soul with a curious face.
Vivian, a name known in the science hall,
Where algorithms dance and data doth call.

Today marks the journey of another year,
A celebration of joy, of cheer, so dear.
For Vivian, whose heart with Kirby beats in tune,
A bond of pink and dreams beneath the moon.

In lines of code, a world she weaves so bright,
With Kirby by her side, in the soft twilight.
Together, they embark on quests untold,
In digital realms, where stories unfold.

Her keyboard clicks, a melody so sweet,
A symphony of logic, where challenges meet.
Vivian, a wizard in the computer's eye,
With Kirby, in starlight, they soar and fly.

On this day of days, her spirit shines so clear,
A beacon of innovation, without any fear.
Happy birthday, Vivian, may your dreams take flight,
With Kirby as your companion, in the starlit night.

So raise a toast to the journeys yet to be,
In the vast, uncharted realms of possibility.
For Vivian, a future bright and wide,
With Kirby, forever, by her side.
